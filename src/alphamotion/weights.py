"""Weight registry: our artifacts from HF, third-party from their origins.

Our HF repo carries ONLY AlphaMotion's own weights and curated motion assets.
The complete core download is roughly 1 GB because native playback requires
the lossless packed dual-stream code library in addition to model weights.
Big third-party generation models and T5 stay at their original
sources and download on first use — cleaner licensing, small repo.
